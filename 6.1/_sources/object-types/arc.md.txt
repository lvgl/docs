# Arc (lv_arc)

## Overview

The *Arc* object **draws an arc** within **start and end angles** and with a given **thickness**.

### Angles

To set the angles, use the `lv_arc_set_angles(arc, start_angle, end_angle)` function. The zero degree is at the bottom of the object and the degrees are increasing in a counter-clockwise direction.
The angles should be in [0;360] range.

### Notes
The **width and height** of the *Arc* should be the **same**.

Currently, the *Arc* object **does not support anti-aliasing**.

## Styles
To set the style of an *Arc* object, use `lv_arc_set_style(arc, LV_ARC_STYLE_MAIN, &style)`

- **line.rounded** - make the endpoints rounded (opacity won't work properly if set to 1)
- **line.width** - the thickness of the arc
- **line.color** - the color of the arc.
- **body.opa** - opacity of the arc.

## Events
