# LED (lv_led)

## Overview

The LEDs are rectangle-like (or circle) object. 

### Brightness
You can set their brightness with `lv_led_set_bright(led, bright)`. The brightness should be between 0 (darkest) and 255 (lightest).

### Toggle
Use `lv_led_on(led)` and `lv_led_off(led)` to set the brightness to a predefined ON or OFF value. The `lv_led_toggle(led)` toggles between the ON and OFF state.

## Styles

The LED uses one style which can be set by `lv_led_set_style(led, LV_LED_STYLE_MAIN, &style)`. 
To determine the appearance, the `style.body` properties are used. 

The colors are darkened and shadow width is reduced at a lower brightness and gains its original value at brightness 255 to show a lighting effect.  

The default style is: `lv_style_pretty_color`. Note that, the LED doesn't look like a LED with the default style so you should create your style. See the example below.
