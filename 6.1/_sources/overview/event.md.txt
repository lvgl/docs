# Events

Events are triggered in LittlevGL when something happens which might be interesting to the user, e.g. if an object:
- is clicked
- is dragged
- its value has changed, etc.

The user can assign a callback function to an object to see these events. In practice, it looks like this:
```c
lv_obj_t * btn = lv_btn_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
lv_obj_set_event_cb(btn, my_event_cb);   /*Assign an event callback*/

...

static void my_event_cb(lv_obj_t * obj, lv_event_t event)
{
    switch(event) {
        case LV_EVENT_PRESSED:
            printf("Pressed\n");
            break;

        case LV_EVENT_SHORT_CLICKED:
            printf("Short clicked\n");
            break;

        case LV_EVENT_CLICKED:
            printf("Clicked\n");
            break;

        case LV_EVENT_LONG_PRESSED:
            printf("Long press\n");
            break;

        case LV_EVENT_LONG_PRESSED_REPEAT:
            printf("Long press repeat\n");
            break;

        case LV_EVENT_RELEASED:
            printf("Released\n");
            break;
    }

       /*Etc.*/
}
```

More objects can use the same *event callback*.

## Event types

The following event types exist:

### Generic events

All objects (such as Buttons/Labels/Sliders etc.) receive these generic events regardless of their type.

#### Related to the input devices
These are sent when an object is pressed/released etc. by the user. They are used not only for *Pointers* but can used for *Keypad*, *Encoder* and *Button* input devices as well. Visit the [Overview of input devices](/overview/indev) section to learn more about them.
- **LV_EVENT_PRESSED** The object has been pressed
- **LV_EVENT_PRESSING** The object is being pressed (sent continuously while pressing)
- **LV_EVENT_PRESS_LOST** The input device is still being pressed but is no longer on the object
- **LV_EVENT_SHORT_CLICKED** Released before `LV_INDEV_LONG_PRESS_TIME` time. Not called if dragged.
- **LV_EVENT_LONG_PRESSED**  Pressing for `LV_INDEV_LONG_PRESS_TIME` time.  Not called if dragged.
- **LV_EVENT_LONG_PRESSED_REPEAT** Called after `LV_INDEV_LONG_PRESS_TIME` in every `LV_INDEV_LONG_PRESS_REP_TIME` ms.  Not called if dragged.
- **LV_EVENT_CLICKED** Called on release if not dragged (regardless to long press)
- **LV_EVENT_RELEASED**  Called in every case when the object has been released even if it was dragged. Not called if slid from the object while pressing and released outside of the object. In this case, `LV_EVENT_PRESS_LOST` is sent.

#### Related to pointer
These events are sent only by pointer-like input devices (E.g. mouse or touchpad)
- **LV_EVENT_DRAG_BEGIN** Dragging of the object has started
- **LV_EVENT_DRAG_END** Dragging finished (including drag throw)
- **LV_EVENT_DRAG_THROW_BEGIN** Drag throw started (released after drag with "momentum")

#### Related to keypad and encoder
These events are sent by keypad and encoder input devices. Learn more about *Groups* in [overview/indev](Input devices) section.
- **LV_EVENT_KEY** A *Key* is sent to the object. Typically when it was pressed or repeated after a long press
- **LV_EVENT_FOCUSED** The object is focused in its group
- **LV_EVENT_DEFOCUSED** The object is defocused in its group

#### General events
Other general events sent by the library.
- **LV_EVENT_DELETE** The object is being deleted. Free the related user-allocated data.

### Special events
These events are specific to a particular object type.
- **LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED** The object value has changed (e.g. for a [Slider](/object-types/slider))
- **LV_EVENT_INSERT** Something is inserted to the object. (Typically to a [Text area](/object-types/ta))
- **LV_EVENT_APPLY**  "Ok", "Apply" or similar specific button has clicked. (Typically from a [Keyboard](/object-types/kb) object)
- **LV_EVENT_CANCEL** "Close", "Cancel" or similar specific button has clicked. (Typically from a [Keyboard](/object-types/kb) object)
- **LV_EVENT_REFRESH** Query to refresh the object. Never sent by the library but can be sent by the user.

Visit particular [Object type's documentation](/object-types/index) to understand which events are used by an object type.

## Custom data
Some events might contain custom data. For example, `LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED` in some cases tells the new value. For more information, see the particular [Object type's documentation](/object-types/index).
To get the custom data in the event callback use `lv_event_get_data()`.

The type of the custom data depends on the sending object but if it's a
- single number then it's `uint32_t *` or `int32_t *`
- text then `char * ` or `const char *`


## Send events manually

To manually send events to an object, use `lv_event_send(obj, LV_EVENT_..., &custom_data)`.

For example, it can be used to manually close a message box by simulating a button press (although there are simpler ways of doing this):
```c
/*Simulate the press of the first button (indexes start from zero)*/
uint32_t btn_id = 0;
lv_event_send(mbox, LV_EVENT_VALUE_CHANGED, &btn_id);
```

Or to perform refresh generically:
```c
lv_event_send(label, LV_EVENT_REFRESH, NULL);
```
