# Styles

*Styles* are used to set the appearance of the objects. A style is a structure with attributes like colors, paddings, opacity, font, etc.

There is a common style type called **lv_style_t** for every object type.

By setting the fields of the `lv_style_t` variables and assigning them to objects with `lv_obj_set_style`, you can influence the appearance of the objects.

``` important:: The objects only store a pointer to a style so the style cannot be a local variable which is destroyed after the function exits. **You should use static, global or dynamically allocated variables.**
```

```c
/* file scope */
lv_style_t style_1;             /*OK! Global variables for styles are fine*/
static lv_style_t style_2;      /*OK! Static variables outside the functions are fine*/
void my_screen_create(void)
{
  /* function scope */
  static lv_style_t style_3;    /*OK! Static variables in the functions are fine*/
  lv_style_t style_4;           /*WRONG! Styles can't be local variables*/

  ...
}
```

## Use the styles

Objects have a *main style* which determines the appearance of their background or main section. However, some object types have additional styles too.

For example, a slider has 3 styles:
- Background (main style)
- Indicator
- Know

Some object types only have one style. For example:
- Label
- Image
- Line, etc.

Every object type implements its own version of the style setter and getter functions. You should use these instead of `lv_obj_set_style` where possible. For example:
```c
const lv_style_t * btn_style = lv_btn_get_style(btn, LV_BTN_STYLE_REL);
lv_btn_set_style(btn, LV_BTN_STYLE_REL, &new_style);
```

To see the styles supported by an object type  (*LV_<OBJ_TYPE>_STYLE_<STYLE_TYPE>*), check the documentation of the particular [Object type](/object-types/index).

If you **modify a style which is already used** by one or more objects, then the objects have to be notified about the style is changed. There are two options to do this notification:

```c
/*Notify an object about its style is modified*/
void lv_obj_refresh_style(lv_obj_t * obj);

/*Notify all objects with a given style. (NULL to notify all objects)*/
void lv_obj_report_style_mod(void * style);
```

`lv_obj_report_style_mod` will only refresh the *Main styles* of objects. If you change a different style, you will have to use `lv_obj_refresh_style`. 

## Inherit styles

If the *Main style* of an object is `NULL`, then its style will be inherited from its parent's style. It makes easier to create a consistent design. Don't forget a style describes a lot of properties at the same time. So for example, if you set a button's style and create a label on it with `NULL` style, then the label will be rendered according to the button's style. In other words, the button makes sure its children will look good on it.

Setting the `glass` style property will prevent inheriting that style (i.e. cause the child object to inherit its style from its grandparent). You should use it if the style is transparent so children use colors and features from its grandparent. Otherwise, the child objects would also be transparent.

## Style properties
A style has 5 main parts: common, body, text, image and line. Each object type only uses the fields which are relevant to it.
For example, *Lines* don't care about the *letter_space*, because they are not concerned with rendering text.

To see which fields are used by an object type, see their [Documentation](/object-types/index).

The fields of a style structure are the followings:

#### Common properties
  * **glass** 1: Do not inherit this style

#### Body style properties
Used by the rectangle-like objects
  - **body.main_color** Main color (top color)
  - **body.grad_color** Gradient color (bottom color)
  - **body.radius** Corner radius. (set to `LV_RADIUS_CIRCLE` to draw circle)
  - **body.opa** Opacity (0..255 or *LV_OPA_TRANSP*, *LV_OPA_10*, *LV_OPA_20* ... *LV_OPA_COVER*)
  - **body.border.color** Border color
  - **body.border.width** Border width
  - **body.border.part** Border parts (*LV_BORDER_LEFT/RIGHT/TOP/BOTTOM/FULL* or 'OR'ed values)
  - **body.border.opa** Border opacity (0..255 or *LV_OPA_TRANSP*, *LV_OPA_10*, *LV_OPA_20* ... *LV_OPA_COVER*)
  - **body.shadow.color** Shadow color
  - **body.shadow.width** Shadow width
  - **body.shadow.type** Shadow type (*LV_SHADOW_BOTTOM/FULL*)
  - **body.padding.top** Top padding
  - **body.padding.bottom** Bottom padding
  - **body.padding.left** Left padding
  - **body.padding.right** Right padding
  - **body.padding.inner** Inner padding (between content elements or children)

#### Text style properties
Used by the objects which show texts
  - **text.color** Text color
  - **text.sel_color** Selected text color
  - **text.font** Pointer to a font
  - **text.opa** Text opacity (0..255 or LV_OPA_TRANSP, LV_OPA_10, LV_OPA_20 ... LV_OPA_COVER*)
  - **text.letter_space** Letter space
  - **text.line_space** Line space

#### Image style properties
Used by image-like objects or icons on objects
  - **image.color** Color for image re-coloring based on the brightness of its pixels
  - **image.intense** Re-color intensity (0..255 or *LV_OPA_TRANSP*, *LV_OPA_10*, *LV_OPA_20* ... *LV_OPA_COVER*)
  - **image.opa** Overall image opacity (0..255 or *LV_OPA_TRANSP*, *LV_OPA_10*, *LV_OPA_20* ... *LV_OPA_COVER*)

#### Line style properties
Used by objects containing lines or line-like elements
  - **line.color** Line color
  - **line.width** Line width
  - **line.opa** Line opacity (0..255 or *LV_OPA_TRANSP*, *LV_OPA_10*, *LV_OPA_20* ... *LV_OPA_COVER*)

## Built-in styles
There are several built-in styles in the library:

![](/misc/style-built-in.png "Built-in styles in LittlevGL Embedded Graphics Library")

As you can see, there are built-in styles for screens, buttons, solid containers, and transparent containers.

The `lv_style_transp`, `lv_style_transp_fit` and `lv_style_transp_tight` differ only in paddings: for `lv_style_transp_tight` all paddings are zero, for `lv_style_transp_fit` only horizontal and vertical paddings are zero but has inner padding.

``` important:: Transparent built-in styles have *glass = 1* by default which means these styles (e.g. their colors) won't be inherited by children.
```

The built in styles are global `lv_style_t` variables. You can use them like:
```c
lv_btn_set_style(obj, LV_BTN_STYLE_REL, &lv_style_btn_rel)
```

## Create new styles
You can either modify the built-in styles or can create new styles.

When creating new styles, it's recommended to first copy a built-in style with `lv_style_copy(&dest_style, &src_style)` to be sure all fields are initialized with the proper value.

Do not forget to initialize the new style as `static` or `global`. For example:
```c
static lv_style_t my_red_style;
lv_style_copy(&my_red_style, &lv_style_plain);
my_red_style.body.main_color = LV_COLOR_RED;
my_red_style.body.grad_color = LV_COLOR_RED;
```


## Style animations
You can change the styles with animations using `lv_style_anim_...()` function. The `lv_style_anim_set_styles()` uses 3 styles. Two styles are required to represent the *start* and *end* state, and a third style required for the *animation*.

Here is an example to show how it works.

```c
lv_anim_t a;
lv_style_anim_init(&a);                                                 /*A basic initialization*/
lv_style_anim_set_styles(&a, &style_to_anim, &style_start, &style_end); /*Set the styles to use*/
lv_style_anim_set_time(&a, duration, delay);                           /*Set the duration and delay*/
lv_style_anim_create(&a);                                               /*Create the animation*/
```

Essentially, `style_start` and `style_end` remain unchanged, and `style_to_anim` is interpolated over the course of the animation.
 
See `lv_core/lv_style.h` to know the whole API of style animations.

Check [Animations](/overview/animation) for more information.

## Style example
The example below demonstrates the usage of styles.

![](/misc/style-example.png "Styles usage example in LittlevGL Embedded Graphics Library")
```c
/*Create a style*/
static lv_style_t style1;
lv_style_copy(&style1, &lv_style_plain);    /*Copy a built-in style to initialize the new style*/
style1.body.main_color = LV_COLOR_WHITE;
style1.body.grad_color = LV_COLOR_BLUE;
style1.body.radius = 10;
style1.body.border.color = LV_COLOR_GRAY;
style1.body.border.width = 2;
style1.body.border.opa = LV_OPA_50;
style1.body.padding.left = 5;            /*Horizontal padding, used by the bar indicator below*/
style1.body.padding.right = 5;
style1.body.padding.top = 5;            /*Vertical padding, used by the bar indicator below*/
style1.body.padding.bottom = 5;
style1.text.color = LV_COLOR_RED;

/*Create a simple object*/
lv_obj_t *obj1 = lv_obj_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
lv_obj_set_style(obj1, &style1);                        /*Apply the created style*/
lv_obj_set_pos(obj1, 20, 20);                           /*Set the position*/

/*Create a label on the object. The label's style is NULL by default*/
lv_obj_t *label = lv_label_create(obj1, NULL);
lv_obj_align(label, NULL, LV_ALIGN_CENTER, 0, 0);       /*Align the label to the middle*/

/*Create a bar*/
lv_obj_t *bar1 = lv_bar_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
lv_bar_set_style(bar1, LV_BAR_STYLE_INDIC, &style1);    /*Modify the indicator's style*/
lv_bar_set_value(bar1, 70);                             /*Set the bar's value*/
```

## Themes
Creating styles for the GUI is challenging because you need a deeper understanding of the library, and you need to have some design skills. Also, it takes a lot of time to create so many styles for many different objects.

Themes are introduced to speed up the design part. A theme is a style collection which contains the required styles for every object type. For example, 5 styles for a button to describe its 5 possible states.
Check the [Existing themes](https://littlevgl.com/themes) or try some in the [Live demo](https://littlevgl.com/live-demo) section. The [theme selector demo](https://littlevgl.com/demo-theme-selector) is useful to see how a given theme and color hue looks on the display.

To be more specific, a theme is a structure variable that contains a lot of `lv_style_t *` fields. For buttons:
```c
theme.btn.rel       /*Released button style*/
theme.btn.pr        /*Pressed button style*/
theme.btn.tgl_rel   /*Toggled released button style*/
theme.btn.tgl_pr    /*Toggled pressed button style*/
theme.btn.ina       /*Inactive button style*/
```

A theme can initialized by: `lv_theme_<name>_init(hue, font)`. Where `hue` is a Hue value from [HSV color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue) (0..360) and `font` is the font applied in the theme (`NULL` to use the `LV_FONT_DEFAULT`)

When a theme is initialized its styles can be used like this:

![](/misc/theme-example.png "Theme usage example in Littlev Embedded Graphics Library")

```c
/*Create a default slider*/
lv_obj_t *slider = lv_slider_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
lv_slider_set_value(slider, 70);
lv_obj_set_pos(slider, 10, 10);

/*Initialize the alien theme with a reddish hue*/
lv_theme_t *th = lv_theme_alien_init(10, NULL);

/*Create a new slider and apply the themes styles*/
slider = lv_slider_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
lv_slider_set_value(slider, 70);
lv_obj_set_pos(slider, 10, 50);
lv_slider_set_style(slider, LV_SLIDER_STYLE_BG, th->slider.bg);
lv_slider_set_style(slider, LV_SLIDER_STYLE_INDIC, th->slider.indic);
lv_slider_set_style(slider, LV_SLIDER_STYLE_KNOB, th->slider.knob);
```

You can ask the library to automatically apply the styles from a theme when you create new objects. To do this use `lv_theme_set_current(th)`.

```c
/*Initialize the alien theme with a reddish hue*/
lv_theme_t *th = lv_theme_alien_init(10, NULL);
lv_theme_set_current(th);

/*Create a slider. It will use the style from teh current theme.*/
slider = lv_slider_create(lv_scr_act(), NULL);
```

Themes can be enabled or disabled one by one in `lv_conf.h`.

### Live update
By default, if `lv_theme_set_current(th)` is called again, it won't refresh the styles of the existing objects. To enable live update of themes, enable `LV_THEME_LIVE_UPDATE` in `lv_conf.h`.

Live update will only update objects using the unchanged theme styles, i.e. objects created after the first call of `lv_theme_set_current(th)` or to which the theme's styles were applied manually.
